# PhishGuard Pro Architecture

## System Overview
PhishGuard Pro is a Chrome extension that combines URL analysis with website design feature extraction for advanced phishing detection.

## Core Components

### 1. Extension Structure
- **Manifest V3**: Modern Chrome extension architecture
- **Service Worker**: Background processing and ML model management
- **Content Scripts**: Website analysis and feature extraction
- **Popup Interface**: User interaction and results display

### 2. Machine Learning Pipeline

#### URL Features
- Domain analysis (length, entropy, suspicious patterns)
- URL structure (path depth, parameters, redirects)
- Brand impersonation detection
- TLD and subdomain analysis

#### Design Features
- Visual layout analysis (form placement, button styles)
- Color scheme analysis
- Typography and font analysis
- Logo and branding detection
- Page structure patterns

#### Model Integration
- Feature combination and normalization
- Real-time prediction with confidence scores
- Model loading and caching
- Continuous learning and updates

### 3. Data Flow
1. User navigates to webpage
2. Content script extracts URL and design features
3. Features sent to background service worker
4. ML model processes features
5. Results displayed in popup/notifications
6. User feedback collected for model improvement

## Security Considerations
- Local processing (no data sent to external servers)
- Encrypted model storage
- Privacy-preserving feature extraction
- Secure communication between extension components
